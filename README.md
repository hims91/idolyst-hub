## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
- Database service (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/founder-platform.git
   cd founder-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Backend Setup (TODO)

1. Create a database schema using the provided `database-schema.sql` file
2. Implement API endpoints for:
   - Authentication (login, register, reset password)
   - User profiles
   - Posts and comments
   - Community features
   - Crowdfunding
   - Events
   - Admin functionality

## Database Schema

The application requires a relational database with the following tables:

- crowdfunding_campaigns
- rewards
- badges

Refer to the `database-schema.sql` file for the complete schema definition.

## Deployment

### Frontend

### Backend
Deploy the backend to a service like Railway, Heroku, AWS, or a VPS provider.

### Database
Use a managed database service like Railway PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, or MongoDB Atlas.

## Next Development Steps

1. Implement real authentication with JWT and secure password handling
2. Set up database models and migrations
3. Create API endpoints for all features
4. Connect frontend to the real backend
5. Implement file uploads for images
6. Add email notifications
7. Set up payment processing for crowdfunding
